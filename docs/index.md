## Console Parsing

If you would like to have your logs parsed without the GUI pass the file location of each evtc file as a string. 

Settings can be configured in the GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe.config file. You can also use a custom config file:

```
GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe -c [config path] [logs]
```

To disable windows-specific commandline magic you can use -p:

```
GuildWars2EliteInsights.exe -p [logs]
```

Note it may take some time for each file to parse and they will not be ready to open the moment they are created.
